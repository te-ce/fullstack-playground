# Fullstack Playground

This is a [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) monorepo used as my playground to build and learn fullstack things.

## Things I have done

- Create a Monorepo using pnpm
- Create a backend API using hono
- Work with a SQL Database using Prisma

## Next Steps

- Connect Frontend to Notes API
- Add Authentication to Notes API
- Build another Frontend using Astro
- Build a Frontend just using Vanilla HTML + JS and build a Form for the Notes API
